# CrystalCollector

Instead of using crystals I had ninja Tutles fighting Shredder!

The concept is the same, random target number generated and then different turtles have different numbers that count against the total.  If you land directly on the number you win and you count wins up.  If you don't you lose and your losses go up as well.  

After a loss, the numbers for each div and the numbers for the target are reset using reset functions.  The game now starts over and you can play again.  

Thanks!
